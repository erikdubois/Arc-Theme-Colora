# Arc-Colora Theme for Linux Mint

The goal is to make scripts that make it easy to change the 'accent' colours of the Arc-Theme.


This might also work on other Debian distributions. 
You may have to rename some of the applications.

I have ported the ArcoLinux script to Debian so more people can enjoy them.
