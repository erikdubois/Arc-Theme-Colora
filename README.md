# Arc-Colora Theme

The goal is to make scripts that make it easy to change the 'accent' colours of the Arc-Theme.

### Arc COLORA is capable to have ANY colour YOU like.

Many articles and youtube tutorials can be found here :

http://erikdubois.be/category/themes/arc-based-themes/

The arc theme can be found at https://github.com/horst3180/

# Create your own colour accent theme with these scripts.

Arc is a flat theme with transparent elements for GTK 3, GTK 2 and Gnome-Shell which supports GTK 3 and GTK 2 based desktop environments like Gnome, Unity, Budgie, Pantheon, XFCE, Mate, etc.


### These scripts can also be run on other systems then Linux Mint. Scroll down to the bottom to see on which distro's.


Each time I run these scripts, I added a name of the colour behind it

    Arc to Arc-Sun
    Arc-Dark to Arc-Sun-Dark
    Arc-Darker to Arc-Sun-Darker

Sun is just the name of the colour. You can choose any name.

If you run the scripts on the latest version of the github of Horst <b>then</b> you will have the most recent version with the latest bug fixes.


# Just want to download the themes not build them.

Linux Mint users download here : https://github.com/erikdubois/Arc-Theme-Colora-Collection

On other githubs I do have some specifice Arc Colora themes for that distro when I test the script.

Again just run the scripts on your distro. Depending on cpu power etc it will take about 10-15 minutes.


### Installation

**Important:** The script of Horst3180 is build this way that the output will be to /usr/share/themes and that the directories will be called Arc, Arc-Dark and Arc-Darker. If you have already Arc installed. **It will be overwritten.**

**But we have a script to reinstall the original arc theme at the end.**


To build the arc theme you'll need following applications.

<b>We will install them via script 0.</b>

    * `optipng`
    * `inkscape`
    * `autoconf`
    * `automake`
    * `pkg-config` or `pkgconfig` if you use Fedora
    * `libgtk-3-dev` for Debian based distros or `gtk3-devel` (RPM) and `libgtk-3-devel` in Solus
    * `git` if you want to clone the source directory

There are several tutorial articles about arc colora on several distro's:

	* Linux Mint
	* Ubuntu
	* Solus Budgie

http://erikdubois.be/category/themes/arc-based-themes/



# Install the theme with the following scripts


### A youtube tutorial can be found here :

### http://erikdubois.be/change-colour-arc-theme-horst3180/



**0. Get the source**

First install git

    Debian based
	sudo apt install git

    Arch based
    sudo pacman -S git

    Solus based
    sudo eopkg it git


Get the latest version from Horst - Arc Theme, clone the repository with

    git clone https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme

Get the latest version from Arc Colora, clone the repository with

    git clone https://github.com/erikdubois/arc-theme-colora

Copy/paste all scripts inside the directory

    arc-theme-colora

to

    arc-theme

Copy/paste also the openbox-3 directory over.

Let us run the scripts.

**0. Install the software you will need**

Choose your distro and run the script to install your applications.

    0-install-all-needed-software-for-xxxx.sh


NOW COPY/PASTE ALL SCRIPTS FROM 1 till 8 to Arc-theme folder from Horst3180.
The file starting with 8 has been added since April 2017 to support openbox distro's.
You are not supposed to run number 8 but the scripts need it.


**1. Change the colour**

Use the script to change the colour. Find yourself a nice colour with gpick or online.
It should be a hexadecimal notation WITHOUT the #. Read the script for more info.

	1-change-colors.sh

**2. Delete old assets or png's**

Old png's will have to be deleted. They are still the original blue ones. Read the script for more info.

	2-delete-assets.sh


**3. Make new assets or png's**

This is the most important part. New png's will be created with your colour. This takes time.

	3-make-assets.sh


**4. Build and install the theme**

    4-final-installation.sh

Other options to pass to autogen.sh are

    --disable-transparency     disable transparency in the GTK3 theme
    --disable-light            disable Arc Light support
    --disable-darker           disable Arc Darker support
    --disable-dark             disable Arc Dark support
    --disable-cinnamon         disable Cinnamon support
    --disable-gnome-shell      disable GNOME Shell support
    --disable-gtk2             disable GTK2 support
    --disable-gtk3             disable GTK3 support
    --disable-metacity         disable Metacity support
    --disable-unity            disable Unity support
    --disable-xfwm             disable XFWM support

    --with-gnome=<version>     build the theme for a specific Gnome version (3.14, 3.16, 3.18, 3.20)
                               Note: Normally the correct version is detected automatically and this
                               option should not be needed.


**5. Copy and rename the theme**

If all went well you will find the result in this directory

    /usr/share/themes !!

It has now the standard name Arc, Arc-Dark and Arc-Darker.


We will run the last script nr 5

	- to rename the folders
	- to move the folders to ~/.themes
	- to change the content of the three index.themes

Follow the instructions in the script. It will ask for the name to add behind these standard names.

	Arc-Sun for example


After the installation is complete you can activate the theme with `gnome-tweak-tool` or a similar program by selecting `Arc-Sun`, `Arc-Sun-Dark` or `Arc-Sun-Darker` as Window/GTK+ theme. If you named the theme "Sun". That is just an example.

**6. Erase the theme in /usr/share/themes**

<b>Your personal theme is in ~/.themes with the changed name and changed index.themes IF you ran previous script.</b>

You can erase the ones in /usr/share/themes.

If you want to erase the original files in the folder

	/usr/share/themes

Run this script

	6-clean-up-usr-share-themes.sh



**7. If you want to reinstall the latest version of the original Arc theme**

The script of horst3180  will make (and overwrite) folders Arc, Arc-Dark and Arc-Darker in the /usr/share/themes. So when we ran our script to change the colours, the output of this personal creation will be in /usr/share/themes.

If you want the original Arc theme back. Just run this script

    7-install-original-arc-theme-again.sh


# Select the new theme


After the installation is complete you can activate the theme with your theme manager by selecting `Arc-Sun`, `Arc-Sun-Darker` or `Arc-Sun-Dark` as Window/GTK+ theme.

On top of the yellow arc theme I made a new icon theme from sardi mono numix colora where the body is the same colour as the yellow from the theme.

# Uninstall the theme manually

If you renamed the theme to Arc-Sun for example

    sudo rm -rf /usr/share/themes/{Arc-Sun,Arc-Darker-Sun,Arc-Dark-Sun}
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/themes/{Arc-Sun,Arc-Darker-Sun,Arc-Dark-Sun}
    rm -rf ~/.local/share/themes/{Arc-Sun,Arc-Darker-Sun,Arc-Dark-Sun}
    rm -rf ~/.themes/{Arc-Sun,Arc-Darker-Sun,Arc-Dark-Sun}

Enjoy.

# F  A  Q
--------------------

# What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename

Or you can follow these steps
