# Arc-Colora Theme for Linux Mint

The goal is to make scripts that make it easy to change the 'accent' colours of the Arc-Theme.

This may also work on other Debian distributions since Linux Mint is debian based.

You may have to rename some of the applications.

I have ported the ArcoLinux script to Debian so more people can enjoy them.

The video underneath is a tutorial how to port a script from Arch Linux to Debian. The same workflow can be used to port it to Suse, Void or any other Linux out there.
